Full-stack NLP application for Telugu news summarization and speech generation.

**Status:** Research paper under review at **ICANITS 2026**.

The system supports direct Telugu text input, URL-based article extraction, extractive TF-IDF summarization, transformer-based mT5 summarization, and optional Telugu text-to-speech audio generation.

## 🚀 Live Demo

- Frontend: https://automated-telugu-text-summarization.vercel.app/
- Backend API: https://automated-telugu-text-summarization-and-s2gz.onrender.com
- API Docs: https://automated-telugu-text-summarization-and-s2gz.onrender.com/docs
- Health Check: https://automated-telugu-text-summarization-and-s2gz.onrender.com/health

For the smoothest demo on free hosting, start with the `TF-IDF` method. Transformer requests may take longer because the model is loaded lazily.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture](assets/system_architecture.svg)

```text
React + Vite Frontend (Vercel)
        |
        | VITE_API_URL
        v
FastAPI Backend (Render Docker)
        |
        | extract -> clean -> summarize -> optional TTS
        v
TF-IDF / Hugging Face mT5 / Edge TTS
```

The system follows a modular NLP pipeline:

```text
Input text / URL
      |
      v
FastAPI Backend
      |
      v
Extract -> Clean -> Summarize -> Optional Text-to-Speech
      |
      v
JSON summary response + optional MP3 audio URL
```

The backend is designed to keep the API responsive even when transformer loading fails. If the mT5 tokenizer or model cannot be loaded, the summarization path logs the root cause and returns a TF-IDF summary instead of crashing the API. API responses expose both the requested model and the model that actually executed, so fallback results are never labeled as mT5.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Lightweight health check |
| GET | `/docs` | FastAPI Swagger documentation |
| POST | `/summarize` | Summarize pasted Telugu text |
| POST | `/process-url` | Extract and summarize an article URL |
| GET | `/latest-news` | Fetch and summarize Telugu news |
| GET | `/audio/{filename}` | Serve generated MP3 files |

## 🔊 Speech System

- Implemented using Edge TTS
- Uses a Telugu neural voice for MP3 generation
- Generated audio is written to `backend/data/`
- Audio files are served by FastAPI through `/audio/{filename}`
- On free hosting, generated files may not persist after restarts

## 🛠️ Local Setup

### Backend

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd backend
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Tokenizer dependencies are included in `requirements.txt`. mT5/SentencePiece loading requires both `sentencepiece` and `protobuf`; missing `protobuf` can cause tokenizer initialization to fail and trigger the TF-IDF fallback path.

Backend runs at:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

For local frontend-to-backend communication, create `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## 🐳 Docker Backend

Build the backend image from the project root:

```bash
docker build -t telugu-news-api .
```

Run locally:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --name telugu-news-api \
  -p 10000:10000 \
  -e PORT=10000 \
  -e CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX='https://.*\.vercel\.app' \
  telugu-news-api
```

Test:

```bash
curl http://localhost:10000/health
```

## 🌐 Deployment

### Backend: Render

Use the existing `Dockerfile`.

Recommended environment variables:

```env
PORT=10000
DEBUG=false
CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX=https://.*\.vercel\.app
CORS_ORIGINS=https://automated-telugu-text-summarization.vercel.app
```

### Frontend: Vercel

Set the frontend root directory to:

```text
frontend
```

Build settings:

```text
Install Command: npm ci
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
```

Environment variable:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://automated-telugu-text-summarization-and-s2gz.onrender.com
```

## ⚠️ Deployment Notes

- Render free tier can cold start after inactivity.
- First mT5 request may be slow because Hugging Face models are loaded lazily.
- TF-IDF is recommended for fast demos and health checks.
- `backend/model/` is intentionally excluded from Docker builds to keep the image small.
- If the local fine-tuned model is missing, the app falls back to the public Hugging Face mT5 base model.
- `backend/data/` is used for generated audio files. On free hosting, local filesystem writes may not persist across restarts.
- mT5/T5 tokenizers use SentencePiece. `sentencepiece` is a required dependency; `tiktoken` is included only as a defensive fallback for tokenizer conversion edge cases.

## 📦 Model Notes

The experimental fine-tuned mT5 model is not required for deployment and is excluded from Docker.

Runtime behavior:

1. Try local fine-tuned model if present.
2. Fall back to `csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum` if local model is absent.
3. Fall back to TF-IDF if mT5/tokenizer loading fails.

Fallback visibility:

- `requested_method` is the method selected by the UI or route.
- `executed_method` is the method that actually produced the summary.
- `status` is `ok` or `fallback`.
- `fallback_reason` contains the categorized root cause, such as a dependency failure, missing model files, memory/timeout failure, or tokenizer initialization failure.

To use a local fine-tuned model during development, place it in:

```text
backend/model/mt5-telugu-news-finetuned/
```

Then restart the backend server.

## 📊 Evaluation Snapshot

| Model | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L | BERTScore |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TF-IDF | 0.0324 | 0.0034 | 0.0320 | 0.6728 |
| mT5 Base | 0.0436 | 0.0022 | 0.0427 | 0.7239 |
| mT5 Fine-Tuned | 0.0404 | 0.0019 | 0.0400 | 0.7229 |

Key insight: fine-tuning did not improve performance in this experiment because the dataset was limited and the pre-trained multilingual model already covered a similar distribution.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Pre-trained multilingual models can outperform fine-tuned models when fine-tuning data is limited.
- BERTScore is often more informative than ROUGE for morphologically rich languages like Telugu.
- Fine-tuning large transformer models requires significantly more data and compute for stable gains.
- Extractive methods can show misleading ROUGE behavior because lexical overlap does not always equal semantic quality.
- Production deployments need graceful fallbacks because hosted model loading can fail due to memory, cold starts, or tokenizer issues.
